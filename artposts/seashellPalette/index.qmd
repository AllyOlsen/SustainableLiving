**Medium**: Collected seashells, air-dry clay, clear nail polish

**Process**: After picking out shells from my collection, I created a circle out of air-dry clay to serve as the base for this palette. I then arranged the shells on the clay, firmly pressing them into the surface. After letting this dry for multiple days, I sealed the piece with clear nail polish.

This piece serves a purpose, and provided an opportunity to reuse shells that had otherwise been sitting on display. These shells, having been in my possession for a while, are from beaches I visited as a child and family members that have gotten rid of their collection. Instead of having them sit around, I decided to create a paint palette that aligns with one of my hobbies. Creating a reusable palette allows me to use less paper, as I would typically use to put paint on. While these shells have been taken from the ocean, this piece serves as a reminder to be very cautious in what you take from natural places and to practice "leave no trace" going forward.
