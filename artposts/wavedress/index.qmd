**Medium**: Recycled grocery bags, tape, thread

**Process**: Plastic grocery bags were ironed into thin strips that provided a sturdy base to sew other bags to. Free-standing bags were sewn onto each of four strips, creating a wave-like appearance. The bags that made up the top were sewn together on either end to create more coverage.

Plastic we consume ends up in waterways and the ocean, harming animals and their habitats. The plastic in this dress is used to imitate the waves of the ocean and other bodies of water that are affected by pollution. The polluting material is used to represent the once-pristine habitat that it has since affected negatively.
