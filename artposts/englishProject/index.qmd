**Medium**: Recycled paper, acrylic paint, glue

**Process**: To create this piece, I first gathered recycled materials from past brochures, homework assignments, and magazines. I ripped up these items and divided them into piles based on color. Working off of a reference picture, I aligned them in the proper location to make the piece I had envisioned. Once I had these glued down, I went in with acrylic paint to refine some of the details of the landscape. This brought out the image I aimed to capture and built upon my theme. Below, see a image from the process of creating this piece.

This piece intends to capture the "built environment" that makes up Milwaukee and Marquette University. In the book "The Jungle," by Upton Sinclair, the family lives in a neighborhood built upon a landfill. Kids are described as digging in their yards and discovering treasures that were once other people's trash. In light of this scene, I utilized recycled materials from the Milwaukee area to create a collage of the Joan of Arc Chapel. Brought here many years ago, this chapel originated in France and was rebuilt brick-by-brick here in Wisconsin. To further elaborate on the parallel of the built environment in "The Jungle" and of this chapel, I created the piece out of layers of Milwaukee-specific recycled materials and utilized acrylic paint to build layers upon the recycled paper. This also signifies the importance of reuse and emphasizes the culture of the Midwest.
