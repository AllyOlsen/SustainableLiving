**Medium**: Recycled newspaper, tape

**Process**: Individual pieces of newspaper were first rolled into cylinders before being attached to one another to create a wearable piece.

One of the strongest shapes, each piece of newspaper is one cylinder that contributes to a larger cylinder. Just as trees are able to grow taller as their base gets wider, the circumference of this dress provides a sturdy base for the newspaper it is made up of. However, these cylinders do not create layers around one another, as trees do as they age, but merely create a layer that deceptively appears sturdy. As deforestation removes long-standing trees from the forest to create paper for our consumption, we lose the base structure of our rain forests. Utilizing recycled newspaper in this dress symbolizes the minimal long-term gain humans receive from cutting down trees for our own production needs.
