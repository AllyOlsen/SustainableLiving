**Medium**: Recycled clothing articles, thread

**Process**: This piece was crafted from an original pattern. First, articles of clothing that were partially worn-out were cut into squares and rectangles. These were then sewn together in a large rectangle, cut to fit the pieces of the pattern, and those panels were sewn to create the cardigan.

This cardigan gave a new life to clothing that may have otherwise been sent to the landfill. By giving fabric a second life, we lessen the waste we produce and create new pieces to wear.
