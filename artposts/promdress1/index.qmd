**Medium**: Thrifted fabric, thread

**Process**: This piece was crafted from an original dress pattern. After drafting the pattern and cutting out panels, each piece was sewn together using a sewing machine.

This dress serves as an example for under-consumption. The nostalgic print of the thrifted fabric brings to mind images of a time when most clothing was sewn by hand. With the increasing ability of factories to mass-produce fashion items, the art of creating our own clothes has been lost to fast fashion. By taking the time to craft our own patterns, creating a custom-fitting article of clothing, we can support a timeless wardrobe.
