**Medium**: Wire, Newspaper

**Process**: This first piece was created with a wire skeleton. Newspaper pieces were then charred and used to create the fabric of the umbrella.

The inspiration from this piece sparked from the forest fires occurring throughout the world. With increased intensity due to drought, this charred umbrella strives to embody the wide-scale fires occurring as a result of both drought and climate change. Made out of paper, it would not serve to be a very beneficial umbrella. With the lack of rain, forests continue to be at a larger risk of facing fires. This umbrella no longer serves its function, and is charred as a result of the unexpected weather and natural disasters facing the location.
