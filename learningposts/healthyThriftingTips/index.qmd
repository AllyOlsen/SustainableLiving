While thrifting can lead to exciting finds, it is important to keep health considerations in mind when dealing with older objects. Up until the 2000s, metals that we now know to be dangerous were included in everyday items. Some plates, bowls, and other dishware that came into contact with food has been known to include lead, arsenic, or other metals. Other items, such as makeup, has also contained these dangerous metals, and it is important to be informed about the items that you are using.

Thrifted dishware can be made of glass, ceramic, metal, or porcelain. Any items with paint, which may include dishware made of metal, ceramic, or porcelain, have a higher probability of containing lead due to the ingredients in the paint used on older pieces. Before using these items for food or drinks, you can obtain a lead-testing kit from your local hardware store. These kits allow you to swab the paint and glaze, indicating if the paint contains lead.

Glass items are typically safer from containing lead, but there are a couple of ways to visually inspect glass dishware to avoid the possibility of using a leaded piece in the kitchen. One way to do so is to look for lines along your glassware that indicate it would have been created in a mold, or press. Lead used to be added to glass so that it was easier to work with for long periods of time at a lower temperature. Creating glassware in molds reduced the need for this, as it required less time to create each piece. Additionally, lead glassware is typically heavier due to the addition of lead.

While it is important to keep these tips in mind when purchasing dishes that you will use for food, dishes purchased for decoration, and that will never come into contact with food, need not be checked for heavy metals. Lead enters the body through contaminated food or inhailing dust containing this metal, so these pieces are safe to use as decoration without testing. When purchasing items other than dishes, I recommend never using any beauty products that are expired. Heavy metals are known to be in older makeup, and expired makeup is never recommended for use, regardless.

These tips have been important in my journey to thrift items for my apartment, and I recommend always looking up items you purchase that will make contact with food.
