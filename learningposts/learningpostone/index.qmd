Recycling is one of the main activities promoted as being sustainable, but improperly recycling can have more negative effects than positive. We have all heard of the three main items that are recycled: paper, plastic, and glass. However, in order for these items to be properly recycled, there are a couple of rules that ensure the materials you set in the recycling bin end up getting recycled. Though daunting at first, these tasks can be easily implemented into your routine.

Primarily, all items that are placed in the recycling bin must be dry and free of food debris. Any plastic, glass, or aluminum must be rinsed and dried. Placing an item that is wet or contaminated with food debris may contaminate the rest of the items in that bin. If there is contamination, items typically end up in the landfill.

Preventing contamination is important, and so is the type of bag your put your recycling in. Avoiding using a bag for your recycling bin is your best option, but, alternatively, you can use a clear bag. Clear bags allow the workers at recycling facilities to see that there are recyclable materials within the bag. If an opaque bag is used, the entire bag will get thrown to the landfill. With so many items to sort through, there is not enough time to open bags to check their contents.

Lastly, each city recycles specific plastic. Typically, you can find this information on your local recycling center's website. When deciding what to recycle, look for the recycling codes on the bottom of plastic items. Film plastic is commonly mistaken as a recyclable material. This includes plastic grocery bags, sandwich bags, bubble wrap, and more. These items can be collected and recycled at many local grocery stores, but not placed in your home recycling bin. As well as film plastic, styrofoam is not recyclable.

As well as properly placing items in the recycling bin, avoiding the purchase of materials that can not be recycled is a small step in minimizing waste. If you cannot avoid these purchases, there are many ways to reuse these items to save money and keep waste out of the landfill.
