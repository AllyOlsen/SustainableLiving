Here, I showcase art pieces I have created that emphasize or incorporate the principles of sustainability. Art has always been a large part of my life, and through the pieces I make I hope to send a message about the positive impact that reusing materials can have. As well, I strive to call into question the materialistic principles that our society has come to adopt.
