The first step to learning how to sew is learning how to thread a needle and tie a knot. This is handy for hand sewing, including mending holes, sewing buttons, and embroidery.

First, let's gather our materials:

-   Needle

-   Thread

-   Scissors

Needles come in all shapes and sizes. We need one that has an "eye," or a hole at the end opposite the point. This gives us a place to insert our thread through. I will be using a larger needle to demonstrate this procedure so that it is easier to visualize.

First, cut a string of thread that is double the length you want. It is better to have a piece that is too long than a piece that is too short. After we tie our knot, our thread will end up being double the thickness. This makes it stronger when repairing clothes.

After we cut our piece of string, we thread the string through the eye of the needle, and line up the ends of the string.

Now that the ends are lined up, we can place the thread on our finger and place the needle perpendicular to it. This will create a "+" shape. Place your thumb on top of this crossection.

Use your thumb to hold the string and needle in place on your index finger for this next step. Taking the string from the side farthest from the eye of the needle, the side closest to the point at the moment, wrap the string around the point of the needle three times.

Now, use your thumb to hold the end of the thread, the needle, and the loops we just created in place. We want to gently apply pressure to hold the thread in place. However, we want to be gentle enough so that the thread can slide down the needle as we pull it.

While holding the thread, begin sliding the thread down the needle, pulling the needle away from the string. All of the string should stay in place while the needle moves. Continue to slide the string off the needle and onto the rest of the string.

As we approach the end of the string, our knot will tighten on its own. Once it is at the very end, and has begun to tighten, we can remove the pressure we were placing on the thread and pull both ends of the string to tighten our knot.

Now we have a knot that will not come undone, will not slip through fabric, and is double the strength of a normal knot!
