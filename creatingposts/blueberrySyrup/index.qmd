After receiving lemonade and pineapple juice, I began to think about how I could add new flavors. I decided that this could best be achieved by making a syrup to add to the juice. In the past, I have made lilac syrup, but the lilacs are not currently blooming. In my freezer I had blueberries, so I decided this would be the perfect opportunity to utilize them!

**Ingredients:**

-   1 cup sugar

-   1 cup water

-   1 cup fruit of choice

-   a splash of lemon juice

First, you want to dissolve the sugar in the water, stirring over high heat.

Once it is all dissolved, you can add in your fruit. In this case I used blueberries. You can also rinse and add lilac flowers or any other fruit/flower of choice.

Let the fruit simmer over medium high heat for 5-10 minutes. The lemon juice helps preserve the syrup, keeping it fresh for longer in the fridge.

Once it is done simmering, you can either strain the fruit or just pour the syrup directly into another container. If you are using glass, be sure to let the syrup cool first so that the temperature difference does not break the glass. After you pour the syrup into your container, let it completely cool before transferring it to the fridge.

Now, you can use this syrup for your coffee, tea, or other drinks! This is also the perfect DIY gift for any occasion, especially once flowers come into bloom.
