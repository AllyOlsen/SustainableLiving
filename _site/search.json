    "section": "",
    "text": "Recycling is one of the main activities promoted as being sustainable, but improperly recycling can have more negative effects than positive. We have all heard of the three main items that are recycled: paper, plastic, and glass. However, in order for these items to be properly recycled, there are a couple of rules that ensure the materials you set in the recycling bin end up getting recycled. Though daunting at first, these tasks can be easily implemented into your routine.\nPrimarily, all items that are placed in the recycling bin must be dry and free of food debris. Any plastic, glass, or aluminum must be rinsed and dried. Placing an item that is wet or contaminated with food debris may contaminate the rest of the items in that bin. If there is contamination, items typically end up in the landfill.\nPreventing contamination is important, and so is the type of bag your put your recycling in. Avoiding using a bag for your recycling bin is your best option, but, alternatively, you can use a clear bag. Clear bags allow the workers at recycling facilities to see that there are recyclable materials within the bag. If an opaque bag is used, the entire bag will get thrown to the landfill. With so many items to sort through, there is not enough time to open bags to check their contents.\nLastly, each city recycles specific plastic. Typically, you can find this information on your local recycling center’s website. When deciding what to recycle, look for the recycling codes on the bottom of plastic items. Film plastic is commonly mistaken as a recyclable material. This includes plastic grocery bags, sandwich bags, bubble wrap, and more. These items can be collected and recycled at many local grocery stores, but not placed in your home recycling bin. As well as film plastic, styrofoam is not recyclable.\nAs well as properly placing items in the recycling bin, avoiding the purchase of materials that can not be recycled is a small step in minimizing waste. If you cannot avoid these purchases, there are many ways to reuse these items to save money and keep waste out of the landfill."

Within a week, you will have the beginning sprouts of your future plants!\nMaterials:\n\nPlastic bag\nPaper towels\n(Any) Seeds\nWater\n\nThe first step in setting up your seeds for germination is taking a paper towel and running it under water. This paper towel should be about the size of the bag.\nAfter soaking the paper towel, ring out any excess water.\nWe will then, laying the plastic bag sideways, place this towel in the bottom of our bag. The damp paper towel will cover the bottom of the bag, providing optimal growing conditions for our seeds. See the image below for proper setup.\nYou can then scatter your seeds at the bottom of the bag. Close the bag.\n\n\n\nProper setup to begin germination.\n\n\nAfter a day or two, your seeds will begin to sprout. At this point, you can add a bit more water to the bag if the paper towel appears to be drying out.\n\n\n\nDay two.\n\n\nAfter a week, you seeds should have developed roots and leaves! Some seeds may take longer to sprout, while others will take less time.\n\n\n\nDay 7.\n\n\nAfter they grow to a manageable size, you can plant your seeds in a pot.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Some of my favorite crafts are the ones that allow me to alter items to be more personalized. One project I have worked on recently was one that allowed me to customize my shoes. In the past, I have typically worn converse. As these are made out of canvas, they are the perfect material to either paint or embroider. Branching out from this brand, I had to find a new way to customize my shoes.\nInstead of altering the material by painting or embroidering it, I chose a route that was subtle, but personalized. By weaving different colors of thread through the stitching on the logo of the shoe, I was able to add a splash of color without fully altering the shoe. In the future, I will be able to remove the thread if I feel inclined to switch up the theme.\nThe stitching on this logo was simple to trace, being a fun and easy part to customize. The first task was to thread the needle. I used sewing thread, which is thinner than embroidery floss. Once the thread was on the needle, the next step was to place the needle under the first stitch. This is my starting point. Be sure to do this carefully, as to avoid poking the needle through the fabric.\n\n\n\nStep one, placing our needle.\n\n\nOnce the needle goes under the stitching, we can further pull it through. Once we near the end of the thread, we can tie a simple knot to keep the thread on the stitching.\n\n\n\nStarting the knot.\n\n\nNow that we have a knot, we can continue weaving the thread through the stitches. Always pointing the needle the same way, the thread and stitches begin to form a stripe-like pattern. We continue doing this for the entire length of the logo.\n\n\n\nWeaving the thread through the stitching.\n\n\nIf you wish to change colors midway through, or run out of thread, we can remove the needle from the thread, begin the next color in the same way we began the first, but instead of tying the thread to itself, we can tie it to the next color. A simple double knot will allow the two threads to link together.\n\n\n\nThe final product, prior to cutting the thread.\n\n\nAfter we have the entire logo outlined, we next will cut the thread. I cut the thread down as close as possible, without allowing the possibility of the knot to unravel. To secure these knots in place, I used clear nail polish to secure them. Any clear glue will work as well. Be careful in the application, as to keep any glue off of the fabric."

    "text": "In college, many students strive to keep expenses down. However, there are some things that must be bought from time to time. Typically for me, this is food items. Whether that includes take out or ingredients from the grocery store, I always seem to end up with so much extra waste.\nOne solution I have found to mitigating the amount of this waste that enters the landfill is finding ways to reuse items. Many items that are recycled never end up fully going through the recycling process, making reuse of items a better practice (read more about proper recycling here). Part of the reduce, reuse, recycle trinity, reusing items is an easy way to begin living a more sustainable life.\nSome items are common practice to reuse. Everyone ends up with a plastic bag from the grocery store at one time or another. Many people will use these bags as trash bags, but they could also be made into plarn. Plastic-yarn. Later on, I will do a step-by-step tutorial for how to make your own plarn. There are so many projects you can make using plarn!\nTwo of my favorite items to reuse are plastic take out containers and glass jars.\nGlass jars of all shapes and sizes come in handy for storing food, other random items, or using as Tupperware. I store dried herbs, sauces I make, and fruit in jars that originally contained salsa, marinara sauce, or other food items. Glass can be easily sanitized in the dish washer, and sticky labels remove easily with nail polish remover or hand sanitizer.\n\n\n\nStoring dried chamomile.\n\n\nPlastic take out containers typically also are dishwasher safe. Be sure to check the labels. As long as the lid is air tight (without holes that are occasionally placed to allow heat to escape) these containers can be used many more times than they typically are. Especially on a budget, reusing these items to store food eliminates the occasionally steep cost of other Tupperware items.\nThough these are just a few of the most common items I tend to reuse, I try my best to eliminate as many items as possible from going in the trash. In the future, I will be diving deeper into different projects that are easy to complete at home, utilizing common items you may not give a second thought to throwing away."

With these cherries, I decided to make maraschino cherries. I adapted this recipe from a couple that I found on internet, combining different aspects of each recipe.\nIngredients:\n\nA handful of cherries (pitted)\n1 tbsp lemon juice\n1/2 tsp vanilla extract\n1 cup sugar\n1 cup water\n\nFirst, you will want to cut and pit your cherries. I cut each cherry in half, removing the stem and the pit.\n\n\n\nCutting cherries.\n\n\nOnce all of my cherries were cut, I placed them in a glass jar. Any glass jar will work, whether it is a mason jar or a jar that you washed and reused.\nThe next step is to make your syrup. Stir your water, sugar, lemon juice, and vanilla extract together over medium heat, just long enough for the sugar to dissolve in the water.\n\n\n\nCooking the syrup.\n\n\nAfter the sugar dissolves, you can transfer the syrup to the jar with the cherries. Let this cool to room temperature before placing the lid on the jar and moving it to the fridge. Let the cherries soak in the syrup for 24 hours before consuming.\n\n\n\nMaraschino cherries and syrup.\n\n\nOnce the cherries sit for 24 hours, you can then use both the cherries and syrup. I like using the cherries for ice cream, and the syrup to make Shirley Temple drinks. I have also used the syrup in lemonade, tea, and sparkling water. The cherries can be used for any dessert!"

    "text": "The first step to learning how to sew is learning how to thread a needle and tie a knot. This is handy for hand sewing, including mending holes, sewing buttons, and embroidery.\nFirst, let’s gather our materials:\n\nNeedle\nThread\nScissors\n\nNeedles come in all shapes and sizes. We need one that has an “eye,” or a hole at the end opposite the point. This gives us a place to insert our thread through. I will be using a larger needle to demonstrate this procedure so that it is easier to visualize.\nFirst, cut a string of thread that is double the length you want. It is better to have a piece that is too long than a piece that is too short. After we tie our knot, our thread will end up being double the thickness. This makes it stronger when repairing clothes.\n\n\n\nThreading the needle.\n\n\nAfter we cut our piece of string, we thread the string through the eye of the needle, and line up the ends of the string.\n\n\n\nCreating a “+” shape with our needle and thread.\n\n\nNow that the ends are lined up, we can place the thread on our finger and place the needle perpendicular to it. This will create a “+” shape. Place your thumb on top of this crossection.\n\n\n\nLooping the thread around the needle.\n\n\nUse your thumb to hold the string and needle in place on your index finger for this next step. Taking the string from the side farthest from the eye of the needle, the side closest to the point at the moment, wrap the string around the point of the needle three times.\n\n\n\nPulling the needle through the loops.\n\n\nNow, use your thumb to hold the end of the thread, the needle, and the loops we just created in place. We want to gently apply pressure to hold the thread in place. However, we want to be gentle enough so that the thread can slide down the needle as we pull it.\nWhile holding the thread, begin sliding the thread down the needle, pulling the needle away from the string. All of the string should stay in place while the needle moves. Continue to slide the string off the needle and onto the rest of the string.\n\n\n\nTightening the knot.\n\n\nAs we approach the end of the string, our knot will tighten on its own. Once it is at the very end, and has begun to tighten, we can remove the pressure we were placing on the thread and pull both ends of the string to tighten our knot.\nNow we have a knot that will not come undone, will not slip through fabric, and is double the strength of a normal knot!"

    "text": "Every day, I make myself an iced matcha latte. Making this drink at home saves a lot of money, as well as disposable plastics. Going to get a morning drink from a cafe each day, for an entire year, would result in 365 disposable plastic cups thrown into the landfill. If these cups are recycled, many times they are incorrectly cleaned out. All plastic must be rinsed and dried before it enters the recycling bin. If it is not, it may contaminate the other recyclables, leading to all of the items to enter the trash anyways. Making this at home allows me to reduce my use of disposable plastics, save money, and save time!\nThis recipe is my go-to in the mornings. You can substitute the milk for whichever kind you prefer, and you can swap the brown sugar for maple syrup or a different type of sweetener. I have two reusable glass cups that I rotate between each day. When one is not in use, I am cleaning it.\nIngredients:\n\n1 tsp Matcha powder\n1 tbsp water\n1 tsp brown sugar\n1 tsp vanilla extract\n1/2 cup ice\n1/2 cup milk of choice\n\nFirst, heat up around 1 tablespoon of water. This does not have to be exact, and most of the time I estimate it. You can either heat it up on the stove, or in the microwave. To save time, I typically use the microwave.\nOnce the water is nice and hot, I first add in my brown sugar. This then dissolves. I next add in my matcha powder, and use my milk frother to mix it.\nOnce this is mixed, I add in my ice. Once this mixture is cooled down, I add in my vanilla, my milk, and stir!\nMaking your own matcha at home is super simple, saves time, and saves our planet. You can also replace, or add as an addition, any other flavored syrup of your choice. In the past, I have done lilac. And, typically, it takes me less than five minutes to make!"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Have you every heard of hydroponics? How about aquaponics? Both of these describe ways of growing plants using water. No soil, just water. But, how do they differ?\nAquaponics creates a favorable environment where plants can grow their roots into water that contains fish. As the fish eat, defecate, and recycle the nutrients throughout the tank, the plants are able to take up these nutrients through their roots.\nHydroponics does not utilize the help of fish. Without fish, nutrients must be artificially added to the water. The water cycles through the system, providing direct access to the water and nutrients through a plant’s roots. This results in shorter roots, as they do not need to go far in order to get the food they need.\nAs well, grow lights are also typically a crucial part of these systems. Being on for 18-20 hours per day, the light allows the plants to expedite their growth in a way they would not be able to in nature. Plants typically grow faster and bigger when using hydroponics systems.\nYou may be wondering, what types of plants can I grow using a hydroponics system? We all know that lettuce is typically grown, but are there other types of plants that thrive? Fruits and vegetables that are harvested above ground typically thrive. This includes tomatoes, peppers, and even herbs, such as basil. Vines also do well in hydroponics systems, given they have a rod or other support to climb as they grow.\nCurrently, I am growing loofah gourds to test how well they grow. Already, the seeds planted in the hydroponics system have grown much faster than the seeds that are living outside of it. Those that are in the hydroponics system have three times the number of leaves that those growing in a normal setting do.\n\n\n\nOne of the radishes in the hydroponics system. Closer to 3 in. in length.\n\n\nTo test whether or not it is possible, I have also chosen to grow radishes. Typically, radishes are 1-2 inches in length, and grow under soil. Without soil to grow in, our radishes look slightly misshapen. However, they have grown to maturity in less than two months. And as they have grown, they have continued to grow. Some of the radishes exceeded five inches in length.\nHydroponics provides positive implications for the future of food. It allows growers to utilize less resources, including less soil, water, and labor, and produces food faster, and in any weather. With this technology, the food of the future may be transformed forever."

In my freezer I had blueberries, so I decided this would be the perfect opportunity to utilize them!\nIngredients:\n\n1 cup sugar\n1 cup water\n1 cup fruit of choice\na splash of lemon juice\n\nFirst, you want to dissolve the sugar in the water, stirring over high heat.\nOnce it is all dissolved, you can add in your fruit. In this case I used blueberries. You can also rinse and add lilac flowers or any other fruit/flower of choice.\nLet the fruit simmer over medium high heat for 5-10 minutes. The lemon juice helps preserve the syrup, keeping it fresh for longer in the fridge.\nOnce it is done simmering, you can either strain the fruit or just pour the syrup directly into another container. If you are using glass, be sure to let the syrup cool first so that the temperature difference does not break the glass. After you pour the syrup into your container, let it completely cool before transferring it to the fridge.\nNow, you can use this syrup for your coffee, tea, or other drinks!

Cover it with a wet cloth so that the dough does not dry out.\nAfter it has had time to rest, form the dough into a ball once again. Cover the bottom of the baking dish with flour to prevent the dough from sticking to the pan, and bake at 400 degrees for 30-40 minutes. Once the top of the dough is golden-brown, remove and let cool.\nI love eating mine with olive oil, but there are so many other combinations of oil, butter, and herbs you can eat with it.
