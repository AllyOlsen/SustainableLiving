This encompasses all aspects related to food. The next category is creating. There could have been many names for this section, but this portrays it the best. Third, we have learning. Arguably the most important category. Lastly, we have reusing. This is fairly common, and may be what most people think of when they think sustainability.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Recycling is one of the main activities promoted as being sustainable, but improperly recycling can have more negative effects than positive. We have all heard of the three main items that are recycled: paper, plastic, and glass. However, in order for these items to be properly recycled, there are a couple of rules that ensure the materials you set in the recycling bin end up getting recycled. Though daunting at first, these tasks can be easily implemented into your routine.\nPrimarily, all items that are placed in the recycling bin must be dry and free of food debris. Any plastic, glass, or aluminum must be rinsed and dried. Placing an item that is wet or contaminated with food debris may contaminate the rest of the items in that bin. If there is contamination, items typically end up in the landfill.\nPreventing contamination is important, and so is the type of bag your put your recycling in. Avoiding using a bag for your recycling bin is your best option, but, alternatively, you can use a clear bag. Clear bags allow the workers at recycling facilities to see that there are recyclable materials within the bag. If an opaque bag is used, the entire bag will get thrown to the landfill. With so many items to sort through, there is not enough time to open bags to check their contents.\nLastly, each city recycles specific plastic. Typically, you can find this information on your local recycling center’s website. When deciding what to recycle, look for the recycling codes on the bottom of plastic items. Film plastic is commonly mistaken as a recyclable material. This includes plastic grocery bags, sandwich bags, bubble wrap, and more. These items can be collected and recycled at many local grocery stores, but not placed in your home recycling bin. As well as film plastic, styrofoam is not recyclable.\nAs well as properly placing items in the recycling bin, avoiding the purchase of materials that can not be recycled is a small step in minimizing waste. If you cannot avoid these purchases, there are many ways to reuse these items to save money and keep waste out of the landfill."

    "text": "Learning how to germinate seeds provides a stepping stone for growing your own herbs, vegetables, and more. This can be easily done in anywhere, using a couple basic materials. Within a week, you will have the beginning sprouts of your future plants!\nMaterials:\n\nPlastic bag\nPaper towels\n(Any) Seeds\nWater\n\nThe first step in setting up your seeds for germination is taking a paper towel and running it under water. This paper towel should be about the size of the bag.\nAfter soaking the paper towel, ring out any excess water.\nWe will then, laying the plastic bag sideways, place this towel in the bottom of our bag. The damp paper towel will cover the bottom of the bag, providing optimal growing conditions for our seeds. See the image below for proper setup.\nYou can then scatter your seeds at the bottom of the bag. Close the bag.\n\n\n\nProper setup to begin germination.\n\n\nAfter a day or two, your seeds will begin to sprout. At this point, you can add a bit more water to the bag if the paper towel appears to be drying out.\n\n\n\nDay two.\n\n\nAfter a week, you seeds should have developed roots and leaves! Some seeds may take longer to sprout, while others will take less time.\n\n\n\nDay 7.\n\n\nAfter they grow to a manageable size, you can plant your seeds in a pot. Once they are transplanted, be sure to water them when the soil is dry in order to allow them to thrive!\n\n\n\nPlanted sprout.\n\n\nHappy growing!\n\n\n\nThis page is brought to you by https://www.linkedin.com/in/ally--olsen/"

    "title": "Customizing Your Shoes",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Some of my favorite crafts are the ones that allow me to alter items to be more personalized. One project I have worked on recently was one that allowed me to customize my shoes. In the past, I have typically worn converse. As these are made out of canvas, they are the perfect material to either paint or embroider. Branching out from this brand, I had to find a new way to customize my shoes.\nInstead of altering the material by painting or embroidering it, I chose a route that was subtle, but personalized. By weaving different colors of thread through the stitching on the logo of the shoe, I was able to add a splash of color without fully altering the shoe. In the future, I will be able to remove the thread if I feel inclined to switch up the theme.\nThe stitching on this logo was simple to trace, being a fun and easy part to customize. The first task was to thread the needle. I used sewing thread, which is thinner than embroidery floss. Once the thread was on the needle, the next step was to place the needle under the first stitch. This is my starting point. Be sure to do this carefully, as to avoid poking the needle through the fabric.\n\n\n\nStep one, placing our needle.\n\n\nOnce the needle goes under the stitching, we can further pull it through. Once we near the end of the thread, we can tie a simple knot to keep the thread on the stitching.\n\n\n\nStarting the knot.\n\n\nNow that we have a knot, we can continue weaving the thread through the stitches. Always pointing the needle the same way, the thread and stitches begin to form a stripe-like pattern. We continue doing this for the entire length of the logo.\n\n\n\nWeaving the thread through the stitching.\n\n\nIf you wish to change colors midway through, or run out of thread, we can remove the needle from the thread, begin the next color in the same way we began the first, but instead of tying the thread to itself, we can tie it to the next color. A simple double knot will allow the two threads to link together.\n\n\n\nThe final product, prior to cutting the thread.\n\n\nAfter we have the entire logo outlined, we next will cut the thread. I cut the thread down as close as possible, without allowing the possibility of the knot to unravel. To secure these knots in place, I used clear nail polish to secure them. Any clear glue will work as well. Be careful in the application, as to keep any glue off of the fabric."
