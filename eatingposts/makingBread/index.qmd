One of my favorite bakery items to make at home is artisan bread. It is so simple, and saves me time and money. As well, it is the perfect item to bring to any holiday party.

With just four simple ingredients, artisan bread takes very little time to make.

**Ingredients:**

-   3 cups flour

-   1 1/2 cups warm water

-   1/2 tsp yeast

-   1 tsp salt

Primarily, combine the warm water and yeast in a large mixing bowl. Let this sit for 5-10 minutes, allowing the yeast to bubble up.

Next, mix in the flour and salt. This should form a dough that is sticky, but can be shaped into a ball.

Let the dough rise in the mixing bowl for 8-10 hours. Cover it with a wet cloth so that the dough does not dry out.

After it has had time to rest, form the dough into a ball once again. Cover the bottom of the baking dish with flour to prevent the dough from sticking to the pan, and bake at 400 degrees for 30-40 minutes. Once the top of the dough is golden-brown, remove and let cool.

I love eating mine with olive oil, but there are so many other combinations of oil, butter, and herbs you can eat with it. If you are making this recipe for just one person, I recommend halving the recipe. The bread is good for 3-4 days, stored in an air-tight container, but is best consumed fresh out of the oven!
