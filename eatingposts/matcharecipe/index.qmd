Every day, I make myself an iced matcha latte. Making this drink at home saves a lot of money, as well as disposable plastics. Going to get a morning drink from a cafe each day, for an entire year, would result in 365 disposable plastic cups thrown into the landfill. If these cups are recycled, many times they are incorrectly cleaned out. All plastic must be rinsed and dried before it enters the recycling bin. If it is not, it may contaminate the other recyclables, leading to all of the items to enter the trash anyways. Making this at home allows me to reduce my use of disposable plastics, save money, and save time!

This recipe is my go-to in the mornings. You can substitute the milk for whichever kind you prefer, and you can swap the brown sugar for maple syrup or a different type of sweetener. I have two reusable glass cups that I rotate between each day. When one is not in use, I am cleaning it.

**Ingredients**:

-   1 tsp Matcha powder

-   1 tbsp water

-   1 tsp brown sugar

-   1 tsp vanilla extract

-   1/2 cup ice

-   1/2 cup milk of choice

First, heat up around 1 tablespoon of water. This does not have to be exact, and most of the time I estimate it. You can either heat it up on the stove, or in the microwave. To save time, I typically use the microwave.

Once the water is nice and hot, I first add in my brown sugar. This then dissolves. I next add in my matcha powder, and use my milk frother to mix it.

Once this is mixed, I add in my ice. Once this mixture is cooled down, I add in my vanilla, my milk, and stir!

Making your own matcha at home is super simple, saves time, and saves our planet. You can also replace, or add as an addition, any other flavored syrup of your choice. In the past, I have done lilac. And, typically, it takes me less than five minutes to make!
