I have recently begun making my own lattes at home. Making these at home keeps plastic cups out of the landfill and is also cheaper! Below is my recipe on how to make a caramel iced latte:

**Ingredients**:

-   4 tbsp water

-   1 tsp instant espresso (I use Nescafe's Gold Espresso, Blonde)

-   1 cup ice

-   1/2 cup milk of your choice

-   3 tsp syrup of your choice
