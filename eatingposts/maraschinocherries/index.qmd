The other weekend, my mom and I bought a variety of fruits to make fruit salad. After making the salad, there was one ingredient we were left with lots of: cherries! With these cherries, I decided to make maraschino cherries. I adapted this recipe from a couple that I found on internet, combining different aspects of each recipe.

**Ingredients:**

-   A handful of cherries (pitted)

-   1 tbsp lemon juice

-   1/2 tsp vanilla extract

-   1 cup sugar

-   1 cup water

First, you will want to cut and pit your cherries. I cut each cherry in half, removing the stem and the pit.

Once all of my cherries were cut, I placed them in a glass jar. Any glass jar will work, whether it is a mason jar or a jar that you washed and reused.

The next step is to make your syrup. Stir your water, sugar, lemon juice, and vanilla extract together over medium heat, just long enough for the sugar to dissolve in the water.

After the sugar dissolves, you can transfer the syrup to the jar with the cherries. Let this cool to room temperature before placing the lid on the jar and moving it to the fridge. Let the cherries soak in the syrup for 24 hours before consuming.

Once the cherries sit for 24 hours, you can then use both the cherries and syrup. I like using the cherries for ice cream, and the syrup to make Shirley Temple drinks. I have also used the syrup in lemonade, tea, and sparkling water. The cherries can be used for any dessert!
