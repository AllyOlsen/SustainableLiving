The cookie recipe was adapted from [Mark Beahm's Classic Shorbread Cookie](https://www.simplyrecipes.com/classic-shortbread-cookies-recipe-5268402) recipe.

With the goal of making a batch of shortbread cookies that explored a variety of flavored frosting options, I adapted [The Cafe Sucre Farine's Christmas Tree Shortbread Cookies](https://thecafesucrefarine.com/christmas-tree-shortbread-cookies/) recipe for the frosting.

***Making the cookies:***

**Ingredients:**

-   1 cup of butter (2 sticks), softened

-   1/2 cup sugar

-   1 tsp vanilla extract

-   1/2 tsp salt

-   2 cups flour

First, combine the softened butter, sugar, vanilla and salt and mix until fluffy. Then, add in the flour, one cup at a time. To ensure that the dough does not get too crumbly, evaluate the texture in-between adding the flour. Less than 2 cups may be used. Once the dough is fully mixed, we will chill it.

To make cookies that you are able to slide into shapes, just as I did with a rectangular shape, you will place the dough in plastic wrap and roll it into a log. After doing so, chill it in the fridge for at least an hour. If you would like to make cookies in the future, you can also place the dough in the freezer and defrost when needed.

Once chilled, cut the log into 1/4 in. pieces. Lay these on a sheet pan and place them in the oven. They will bake at 350 degrees for about 20 minutes.

***Preparing the frosting:***

**Ingredients:**

-   2 cups powdered sugar

-   4-5 tablespoons milk

-   Extracts or flavorings of choice (1/4 tsp for each one of six containers; see below)

As I was interested in making cookies with a variety of frosting flavors, I divided my batch of frosting into six containers before adding 1/4 tsp of each flavor. These flavors included vanilla extract, mint extract, lemon extract and zest, raspberry jam, matcha powder, and chai concentrate.

After mixing the frosting, I heated each up for less than ten seconds in the microwave. This allowed them to become a liquid-like consistency without crystallizing the sugar. I dipped each cookie into the frosting and allowed to cool on parchment paper until hardened.
