In college, many students strive to keep expenses down. However, there are some things that must be bought from time to time. Typically for me, this is food items. Whether that includes take out or ingredients from the grocery store, I always seem to end up with so much extra waste.

One solution I have found to mitigating the amount of this waste that enters the landfill is finding ways to reuse items. Many items that are recycled never end up fully going through the recycling process, making reuse of items a better practice (read more about proper recycling [here](https://sustainablyliving.netlify.app/learningposts/learningpostone/)). Part of the reduce, reuse, recycle trinity, reusing items is an easy way to begin living a more sustainable life.

Some items are common practice to reuse. Everyone ends up with a plastic bag from the grocery store at one time or another. Many people will use these bags as trash bags, but they could also be made into plarn. Plastic-yarn. Later on, I will do a step-by-step tutorial for how to make your own plarn. There are so many projects you can make using plarn!

Two of my favorite items to reuse are plastic take out containers and glass jars.

Glass jars of all shapes and sizes come in handy for storing food, other random items, or using as Tupperware. I store dried herbs, sauces I make, and fruit in jars that originally contained salsa, marinara sauce, or other food items. Glass can be easily sanitized in the dish washer, and sticky labels remove easily with nail polish remover or hand sanitizer.

Plastic take out containers typically also are dishwasher safe. Be sure to check the labels. As long as the lid is air tight (without holes that are occasionally placed to allow heat to escape) these containers can be used many more times than they typically are. Especially on a budget, reusing these items to store food eliminates the occasionally steep cost of other Tupperware items.

Though these are just a few of the most common items I tend to reuse, I try my best to eliminate as many items as possible from going in the trash. In the future, I will be diving deeper into different projects that are easy to complete at home, utilizing common items you may not give a second thought to throwing away.
