Thrifting has become a popular to-do, and people everywhere now enjoy the treasure hunt that a trip to the thrift store entails. As this practice increases in popularity, what benefits does this bring to the world of environmentalism?

Choosing to buy second hand can decrease the number of items that end up in landfills each year. By purchasing an item from the thrift store, you decrease the probability that it ends up being thrown away. With so many items making their way to thrift stores, there is always a chance you may find exactly what you're looking for!

By choosing second hand over purchasing from a department store, you are maximizing the life span of an item and the materials that went into creating it. This includes the water, labor, and any natural resources used in production. Rather than driving the demand for an item that is already out there, you are using products that are already available.

Throughout my thrifting adventures I have found many pieces that I have been able to give a second life. This ranges from clothing to decorations, dishware, and footwear, and I take pride in the items that I have been able to repurpose and rehabilitate.
